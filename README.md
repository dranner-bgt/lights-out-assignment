# Lights-Out Project Assignment
Please implement the following "Lights-Out" game.

## Instructions
Implement the specified project in an environment of your choice. 
Create a new GitHub repository which will contain your completed assignment.
**Please do not fork this repository!**

## Specification
A Lights-Out board consists of a grid of light bulbs, some of which are initially on. 
Clicking a bulb will toggle the state of the clicked bulb as well as the state of all bulbs adjacent (von Neumann neighborhood) to it. 
Goal of the game is to switch off all light bulbs.

Levels are defined in [this file](levels/lights-out-levels.json). Your application should download the levels and display the first level on startup.

Display the grid of light bulbs and implement the toggling logic. 

Display a *You won* screen once all light bulbs are switched off.

Display a move counter that is incremented on every toggle action.

Display a *Restart* button that resets the level to its original state.

The [assets](assets) folder contains resources and mock-ups to use.

## Documents to turn in
Send us a link to the GitHub repository you’ve created. The repository should include the following items:
* Source code of the application,
* Instructions how to compile and run the application,
* Time sheet of completed tasks.
